# US-Medical-Insurance-Data
This is a portfolio project applying my Python skills on classes, dictionaries, lists, loops, and iterations. 
I use the data about U.S. Medical Insurance on Kaggle, which includes surveys from over a thousand patients on their ages, sexes, BMIs, number of childrens, smoking statuses, regions, and their yearly charges on health insursance. 
In the code, I use Python to sort the data from the .csv file into storing variables and work through multiple analysis values from there.
